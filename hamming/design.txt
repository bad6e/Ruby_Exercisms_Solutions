1. We have an output that is number that gives us the differnce between two DNA strands (strings of data)

2. We want our code to print out to the screen

3. Most Trivial Case - Computes two characters both with the same letter - doesn't have to do any work  

Min Work Case 

4. 	a. Computes two characters that are different.
	b. Test two characters that are different 
	c. Etc.

Most Complex Case

5. The strands are two different lenghts

6. 	Pseudocode 

	a. Import two sentences 
	b. Read through sentence #1 and store it's characters in an ordered database
	c. Read through sentence #2 and store it's characters in a different ordered database

	d. Read through each position in the database. If the first data position #1 is different from the second database position #1 mark that.

	e. Repeat this for every character in the database. 

	f. Print out the total number of differences in the databased 

7. 	Edge Cases

	a. Strands are different lenghts
	b. Strands contain no characters
