1. We can create a random name for a robot. When we reboot we have created a new name.

If ever the name is a duplicate - rename the robot. 

2. We want it to print a new name to the screen.

3.  Most Trivial - Robot has name 

4.  a. Trivial +1 = Robot name sticks 

	b. +2 = Creating two robots that have different names



5. Test to see if upon reset the name is different (and  possibly the name never is repeated)

6. Create a robot and give it a name. 
   Save the name
   Display the name on the screen

   Reset robot -- give it a new name 
   Check new name to make sure the new name is the same as the old name (possibly check used name database)
   Display the name on the screen
